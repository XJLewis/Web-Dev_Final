        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Baldur's Gate 3?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Baldur's Gate 3 is an RPG set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, developed by Larian Studios. 
            It follows the story of a group of adventurers who become infected with a mysterious parasitic tadpole that grants them dangerous powers. 
            As they seek a cure, they uncover a plot involving dark forces that threaten the world, including an invasion by illithids (mind flayers) and a clash between gods and mortals.
            The game is known for its deep storytelling, character-driven narrative, and extensive player choices. 
            It features a dynamic combat system based on Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules, with turn-based combat and a strong emphasis on strategic planning. 
            Players can choose from a variety of races, classes, and backgrounds for their characters, and interact with NPCs, forge alliances, or make enemies based on their decisions.
